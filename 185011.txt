Task 4: The command to clone the repository from GitHub to the local machine ~
$ git clone https://github.com/Ivana-Trajanoska/SI_2022_lab1_185011.git

To enter the ropository:
$ cd SI_2022_lab1_185011


Task 5: Add new text file
~Pc@DESKTOP-8KGSLV6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/SI_2022_lab1_185011 (master)
$ touch shopping_list.txt

In the text editor, we add five random items: milk, bread, bananas, chocolate, and water. If we were to add this items through the console, that would look like:
~Pc@DESKTOP-8KGSLV6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/SI_2022_lab1_185011 (master)
$ echo $'milk\nbread\nbananas\nchocolate\nwater' > shopping_list.txt

$ git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

	Untracked files:
  	(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	        shopping_list.txt

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

We add the file to the staging area, allowing them to be tracked: $ git add shopping_list.txt
Making the commit: $ git commit -m 'Add 5 items to the shopping list'
After this command we’ll get the following output:
	[master 7a98bbb] Ádd 5 items to the shopping list
 	1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 	create mode 100644 shopping_list.txt

Task 6: Again in the text editor we are updating the list, adding quantity of each item. And again if we were make the changes using the console that would look like:
~Pc@DESKTOP-8KGSLV6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/SI_2022_lab1_185011 (master)
$ echo $'milk x 1\nbread x 2\nbananas x 5\nchocolate x 1\nwater x 1' > shopping_list.txt

Now if we check the status with the $ git status command, we get the following message:
	On branch master
	Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  	(use "git push" to publish your local commits)

	Changes not staged for commit:
  	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  	(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	        modified:   shopping_list.txt

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

If we compare the previous status message with this one, we can see that in the first message we were informed that we have untracked file – git has not any knowledge of existing such file. But since we added it, and after the changes we made in the file the message says that the file has been modified.
Performing add and commit command at once: 
~Pc@DESKTOP-8KGSLV6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/SI_2022_lab1_185011 (master)
$ git commit -am 'Add quantities to the items'

 	[master f389a50] Add quantities to the items
 	1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)

$ git branch branch1
~Pc@DESKTOP-8KGSLV6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/SI_2022_lab1_185011 (master)
$ git branch branch2

Task 9: Synchronizing the local branches with the remote repository

	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in shopping_list.txt
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

When merging branch1 with master branch, there were not any conflicts.
When merging branch2 with master, there was a conflict. As solution of this conflict, I chose to accept the changes made in the branch2. So, the list of products would look like:
milk x 1
bread x 2
bananas x 5
ice cream x 1
water x 1
